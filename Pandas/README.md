# Introduction to pandas

This repository is filled with IPython Notebooks that explore the pandas library.

It is used in the [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) course [Introduction to pandas](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-pandas/upcoming).

## Installation

To run these notebooks locally, you'll need to be able to run Jupyter Notebooks.
 
 We recommend using [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
 
```bash
conda create --name treehouse-pandas --file requirements.txt
conda activate treehouse-pandas
jupyter notebook
```

## Layout

The notebooks are meant to be followed in order and are prefixed with stages and notebook names.

For instance, the prefix `s1n01-` refers for Stage 1, Notebook 1.

There are several optional challenges that throughout the course, ensure you choose Restart and Run the entire notebook to see the proper results.

Thanks for hanging out and please keep me posted on your journey! ðŸš€
